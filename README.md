Sound Sensor with LED ðŸ”ŠðŸ’¡



This project uses a sound sensor to control an LED with an Arduino. The LED lights up when the sound sensor detects noise above a certain threshold, making it a fun way to create sound-reactive lighting.



Project Overview
Components: Arduino, sound sensor module, LED, resistor (220Î© or 330Î©), jumper wires, and breadboard.
Functionality: When the sound sensor detects noise above a specific threshold, the LED turns on. Otherwise, the LED remains off.
Applications: Useful for creating a sound-sensitive light or visual noise indicator.
Components Required
Arduino Board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
Sound Sensor Module (e.g., KY-038)
LED
Resistor (220Î© or 330Î© for LED)
Breadboard and Jumper Wires


Circuit Diagram
Connect VCC on the sound sensor to 5V on the Arduino.
Connect GND on the sound sensor to GND on the Arduino.
Connect the AO (analog output) on the sound sensor to A0 on the Arduino.
Connect the LED anode (longer leg) to pin 13 (or another digital pin).
Connect a 220Î© resistor between the LED cathode (shorter leg) and GND.


Usage
Upload the Code: Open the Arduino IDE, paste the code into a new sketch, and upload it to your Arduino board.
Run the Project: Observe the LEDâ€™s response to surrounding sound levels. When noise levels exceed the threshold, the LED will light up.

Customization
Adjust Sensitivity: Change the threshold variable to make the LED more or less sensitive to noise.
Multiple LEDs: You can add more LEDs to different pins and use varied thresholds for each.
Sound Level Display: Monitor the sound level in real-time using the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE.
